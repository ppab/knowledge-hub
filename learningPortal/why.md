I created this portal to document all my learnings
Having it centralized will allow me to easy access all the resources and jump back to explore the knowledge in case I
need it.

At the end Long time learning comes by practicing.

## Main Objectives :

0. [Strong solid Linux and Terminal Skills ](strong-linux-skils.md)
   1. security
1. [Strong Tmux Skills ](strong-tmux.md)
    - vi motions
    - tmux
1. Strong Git abilities
2. Process for commiting ` Conventional Commits `

3. CI:
   - process for testing and building the application
     - for source code
     - for docker containers
4. Continuous Delivery:
2. Crete "Professional World class software applications" with Excellent architecture designs
   
3. Practice different system architectures such as :
    - event driver
    - rest
    - Onion
    - Microservices
4. Learn how to structure and admin a "Platform " of microservices in kubernetes with monitoring.

If I want to learn :

## Programing Languagues:

- TS
- Go
- Python
- Rust
- Ruby

## Cloud Computing (AWS)

- Ec2
- S3
- CI/CD
-

## Docker

## Linux

## Tmux

## vim motions

## Kubernetes

## FrontEnd

## Network Protocols:

### Server Events

### Websockets

### GraphQL

-Then I need to practice them often. For this I have several Ideas:

> One of the main reasons of being on the cloud is that we can have high availability and fault tolerance.
> Also the fact that we could be using serverless services can help us to "outsource"  those tasks to the cloud provider
> without the need te manage them ourselves.

1. Create small programs with `different languages`. They would be `dockerized`.
2. Deploy them to the cloud.
    - In lambdas ("one for each language").
    - In a ec2 `linux` server.
    - In a `Kubernetes managed service` (EKS is expensive, maybe found another solution)
    - ECS:
        - Maybe I could have a dockerized linux server, deployed in an ec2, when then service autoscales we would use
          Fargate!.
