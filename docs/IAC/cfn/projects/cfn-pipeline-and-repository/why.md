I created this project because I myself repeating allot of code in different CFN templates, therefore I decided to create centralized repository for our cfn templates 

This centralized repository would be configured in a pipeline so that it deploys the latest version of the content to s3.
Having the templates in s3 will allow us to write CFN templates with nested stacks.


You can download the configuration file from [here](/cfn-templates/test.yml).
